# HolidaySearch

This is a C# solution to the Holiday Search programming exercise.

The task is to take the two JSON files in `HolidaySearchLibrary/dataFiles` folder:

```
ðŸ“‚HolidaySearchLibrary
â”— ðŸ“‚dataFiles
  â”£ ðŸ“œflightData.json
  â”— ðŸ“œhotelData.json
```

as source data, and create a small library of code that provides a basic holiday search feature.

# Instructions - Run the Tests

**Prerequisite**: The machine running the application should have [.NET 6.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0) (or above) installed.

To run the tests:

1. clone the repository to your computer
2. then navigate to the `HolidaySearchLibrary.Tests` folder (with `cd` command or otherwise)
3. then run the following command

```c#
dotnet test
```

Then you should see all the test cases have passed.
